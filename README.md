# Analysis of NYC CitiBike Trip Data Using Tableau
---
## :one: Overview of the analysis 

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations located throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken. Citi Bike is a fun and affordable way to get around town. It was designed with convenience in mind for quick trips. Citi Bike is frequently faster than other modes of transportation (particularly when traveling across town), and it is more convenient than owning a bike. Using Citi Bike instead of taxis can save you a lot of money. A year of Citi Bike is also less expensive than two monthly subway passes.

Kate is a tourist from Des Moines, Iowa, who recently visited New York. During her trip, she mostly used CitiBike to get around New York. She was amazed after the trip that she could save a lot of money on taxis and bus fares by using CitiBike, and that she could get around town without getting stuck in traffic. Her enthusiasm for the service prompted her to meet with an angel investor and try to persuade them that it would be a good idea to launch DesBikes, a service similar to CitiBike for the city of Des Moines.

Before deciding whether to fund the DesBikes project, investors could also learn more about the results of CitiBike in New York.

To gain a better understanding of the company's operations, we will use public data from CitiBike and analyze it with Tableau.
